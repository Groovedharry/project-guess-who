We created a gameboard for the game "Guess Who" in javascript

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I think the biggest problem for me this week was my mental from the first week of javascript, but also still not being used to the syntax of javascript and fully understanding everything. It feels at times where I can't explain why things are working. But generally if I had a problem I used W3Schools and watched tutorials from a youtuber called The Net Ninja which have a lot of javascript tutorials which helped me a lot!

I didn't have much planning I spent sometime getting used to the game and how it worked as I barely remember how it work.

if I had more time I would probably have worked continued into the red/black requirement.
